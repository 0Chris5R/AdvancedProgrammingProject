Backend:
- def get_journal_entry: return (
        db.query(JournalEntryModel)
        .filter(JournalEntryModel.id == entry_id)
        .first()
    ) 
    might also work with db.query(JournalEntryModel).get(entry_id)  # shorthand for primary key lookup
- result = JournalEntry.from_orm(db_entry) this is deprecated, have a look at is again when it gets important with agent

Frontend:
- Bigger box to write the Journal in
- Cursor is not visible after enter
- Editing on detailed view throws an error, deleting as well
- Scrolling in Journal Writing is too fast

General:
- Add field for planning for the next day into journal
- Possibility to include attachments to journals
